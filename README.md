This is Gilbert X. Gonzalez's final project for Code in Place in June 2024.

Noodles' Quest is a retro style game inspired by rogue-like games and nudibranchs. This is my first piece of software. I hope you enjoy the game.

Use the num pad to move Noodles the nudibranch around the labrynth of sand and coral. You can use 7, 9, 1, and 3 to move NW, NE, SW, and SE through diagonals. Coral blocks that touch only at the corners don't block diagonal movement. It only matters if the target block is sand or coral. I hope that makes sense.
Move over the algae to collect it for points. You move to the next level once you collect all the algae.
The 'esc' key exits the program.
'r' re-rolls the level (use this if there are impossible to reach algae).
'p' will pause and unpause the game. 

You start every game with 3 lives.

Watch out for the jumping sea spiders! You lose a life if you get bit by a spider. If you are bit, you a reset at the center and the game is paused.
